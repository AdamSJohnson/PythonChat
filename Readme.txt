Requires PyAES

Okay so there are two versions:
ChatRun.py is the console based one and is all done through terminals. 
- 1 to host
- 2 to connect

To run the gui based one here is the order:
- ChatEXPGui.py is the server and should be run first
- ChatEXPGui2.py is the client and should be run to connect to the server

Requires pyaes. 
Hopefully that is all the required stuff needed.
